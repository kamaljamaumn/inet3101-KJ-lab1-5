To compile and execute the C program, use the following commands:

gcc modified_code.c -o dynamic_array
./dynamic_array

Description

This lab focuses on dynamically managing memory using malloc, realloc, and free in C. The program starts with a user-defined array size and continuously resizes as new elements are added. This approach ensures efficient memory usage without predefined limits.
